   abstract = {In this paper, we consider two problems related to single-commodity flows on a directed network. In the first problem, for a given s −t flow, if an arc is destroyed, all the flow that is passing through that arc is destroyed. What is left flowing from s to t is the residual flow. The objective is to determine a flow pattern such that the residual flow is maximized. We provide a strongly polynomial algorithm for this problem, called the maximum residual flow problem, and consider various extensions of this basic model. In the second problem, known as the "most vital arc" problem, the objective is to remove an arc so that the maximal flow on the residual network is as small as possible. Results are also derived which help implement an efficient scheme for solving this problem.},

@article{Caro2004,
   abstract = {The paper deals with a school redistricting problem in which blocks of a city must be assigned to schools according to diverse criteria. Previous approaches are reviewed and some desired properties of a good school districting plan are established. An optimization model together with a geographic information system environment are then proposed for finding a solution that satisfies these properties. A prototype of the system is described, some implementation issues are discussed, and two real-life examples from the city of Philadelphia are studied, one corresponding to a relatively easy to solve problem, and the other to a much harder one. The trade-offs in the solutions are analysed and feasibility questions are discussed. The results of the study strongly suggest that ill-defined spatial problems, such as school redistricting, can be addressed effectively by an interaction between objective analysis and subjective judgement.},
